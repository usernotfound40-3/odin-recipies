    <!-- ingredients list-->

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
    <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>   
    <li>2 eggs</li>   
    <li>½ cup milk</li>   
    <li>½ cup water</li>   
    <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons butter, melted</li>   
    </ul>
    <!-- directions for cooking-->
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, 
            whisk together the flour and the eggs. Gradually add in the milk and water, 
            stirring to combine. Add the salt and butter; beat until smooth.</li>   
        <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, 
            using approximately 1/4 cup for each crepe. 
            Tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the batter coats the surface evenly.</li>   
        <li>Cook the crepe for about 2 minutes, until the bottom is light brown. 
    Loosen with a spatula, turn and cook the other side. Serve hot.</li>   
</ol>
