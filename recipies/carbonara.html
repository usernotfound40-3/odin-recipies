        <li>50g pecorino cheese</li>
        <li>50g parmesan</li>

        <li>2 plump garlic cloves, peeled and left whole</li>

        <li>sea salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <!-- directions for cooking-->

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Put a large saucepan of water on to boil.</li>
        <li>Finely chop the 100g pancetta, having first removed any rind.
             Finely grate 50g pecorino cheese and 50g parmesan and mix them together.</li>
        <li> Beat the 3 large eggs in a medium bowl and season with a little freshly grated black pepper. 
            Set everything aside.
        </li>
        <li>Add 1 tsp salt to the boiling water, add 350g spaghetti and when the water comes back to the boil, 
            cook at a constant simmer, covered, for 10 minutes or until al dente (just cooked).</li>
        <li> 
            While the spaghetti is cooking, fry the pancetta with the garlic. 
            Drop 50g unsalted butter into a large frying pan or wok and, as soon as the butter has melted, 
            tip in the pancetta and garlic.
        </li>
        Leave to cook on a medium heat for about 5 minutes, 
        stirring often, until the pancetta is golden and crisp. 
        The garlic has now imparted its flavour, so take it out with a slotted spoon and discard.
        <li>
            Keep the heat under the pancetta on low. When the pasta is ready, 
            lift it from the water with a pasta fork or tongs and put it in the frying pan with the pancetta. 
            Don’t worry if a little water drops in the pan as well (you want this to happen) and don’t throw the pasta water away yet.
        </li>
        Mix most of the cheese in with the eggs, 
        keeping a small handful back for sprinkling over later.
        <li>
            Take the pan of spaghetti and pancetta off the heat. 
            Now quickly pour in the eggs and cheese. Using the tongs or a long fork, 
            lift up the spaghetti so it mixes easily with the egg mixture, 
            which thickens but doesn’t scramble, and everything is coated.
        </li>
        Add extra pasta cooking water to keep it saucy (several tablespoons should do it). 
        You don’t want it wet, just moist. Season with a little salt, if needed.
        <li>
            Use a long-pronged fork to twist the pasta on to the serving plate or bowl. Serve immediately with a little sprinkling of the remaining cheese and a grating of black pepper.
             If the dish does get a little dry before serving, 
             splash in some more hot pasta water and the glossy sauciness will be revived.
        </li>
