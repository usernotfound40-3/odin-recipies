# odin-recipies
part of the odin project curicillum.

# starting project 06/01/2022.

 i have started the odin project web development course and will now do the final assignment in the html basics course - i will build a basic HTML website containing several recipies - The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.
 
# done

im now done with the website and my summary of this small basic html project is -
- I have now the skills to create a simple website
- While creating it i enhanced my abilities to write the code faster and more efficent using the previous documents as a boilerplate.
- i encountered a problem while dealing with the unordered list at first - soloution was that i forgot to add a "i" to the <li> element. After 5 minutes of head scratching my head connected the dots. haha.

# final thoughts

i think The Odin Project is fun so far. and i could see myself working with this.
